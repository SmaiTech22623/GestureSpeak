# **App Name**: GestureTalk

## Core Features:

- Gesture Label Input: Allows the user to input a text label for a new gesture command.
- Send to Pi: Sends the entered text label to the Raspberry Pi via Firebase for gesture association.
- Gesture Received Display: Displays the gestures received from the Raspberry Pi in real-time using Firebase.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Reads out the received gesture labels using the device's built-in Text-to-Speech engine.
- TTS Toggle: A switch to enable or disable Text-to-Speech output.
- Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase Realtime Database for real-time communication and gesture label storage between the app and Raspberry Pi.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6), evoking a sense of technology and calm.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), nearly white, providing a clean and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) for the 'Send to Pi' button and toggle, drawing attention to interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both body text and headlines, ensuring readability and a modern aesthetic.
- Use simple, line-based icons for clarity, related to actions and statuses (e.g., sending, receiving, TTS on/off).
- A clean, single-column layout with clear sections for input, display, and settings, optimized for mobile usability.
- Subtle animations or transitions when a new gesture is received or when TTS is toggled.
